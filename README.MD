Dance Performance

Choreography: Sarah Fdili Alaoui and Jean Marc Matos

We Consider a Choreography that composes itself insitu according to the behaviours generated by the visitors / participants as observed by the dancers or captured by a set of ubiquitous sensors in the performance space. The research relies on an analysis of the principles of “writing” dance as well as a research on Human Computer Interaction, related to the methods of analysis of the moving body and the semantics of movement that can contribute to movement-based interaction.
